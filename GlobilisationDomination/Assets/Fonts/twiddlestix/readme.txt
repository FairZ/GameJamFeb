OTF: Twiddlestix

Add a little wackiness to your next project. Twiddlestix is a whimsical display font designed with an emphasis on fun. This irregular serif contains basic latin, extended latin, diacritics, punctuation, and kerning. The lowercase characters display some variants to their uppercase counterparts and
serve as "alternates". Although kerning is added slight overlap should be expected especially with European accents. Use Twiddlestix for a children's book, school project, or toy packaging. Many languages are supported but additional characters can be added for a fee.

This font like my others are free for personal use only as long as this readme file stays intact. For commercial use please contact me at dennis@sharkshock.net to discuss an end user license agreement. You can also visit www.sharkshock.net/license for more info and terms. I also design custom 
fonts for companies, logos, and many other things. If you'd like to leave me a PayPal donation you can use my email address above. Your generosity will be most appreciated! 

Thank you for your support!
